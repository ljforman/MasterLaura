I read [Cashing In On Kids](http://www.jsonline.com/watchdog/watchdogreports/38283494.html)

### What datasets were used?

- Wisconsin Shares subsidies 2006-2008
  - Largest recipients and growth in subsidies by year (article cites sifting through 2,500 pages of public records all in)
- Individual (business and family) W-2 forms for those parties who filed for subsidies via the Wisconsin Works program
- Application forms (investigation of specifically cited billing hours)
- Wisconsin state program audit reports 
- Number of children covered under the subsidies act: "The program now covers child-care costs for more than 60,000 kids, up from about 47,000 in 2003 - a 28% jump."
- Criminal complaints filed against suspects

### Where did they come from?
- [Wisconsin subsidies](http://dcf.wisconsin.gov/w2/default.htm)
- State of Wisconsin circuit court criminal division (court records)
- Federal/state tax records

### What's the birth story? 
- [Wisconsin Works (W-2) economic support program](http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/publications/Informational-Papers/Documents/2013/45_w-2.pdf)

### What claims does the story make (based on data)?
- Government subsidies (i.e. taxpayer's money) are being misappropriated to individuals who have submitted fraudulent work claims (wasted tax dollars).
- Key finding:  "the Journal Sentinel was able to identify nearly $750,000 in suspicious child-care disbursements."
  - Support: 
    - Hours worked submitted by individuals were impossible (e.g. one specific mother reported taking just "two days" off during one month and even working all week leading up to her birth, as well as the day she gave birth to seventh child.)
    - Another instance cites, "child-care funding was approved for 85 hours a week even when children were in school all day. If the statements were to be believed, the children would almost never be home." 
- Article also makes a compelling case for the lack of accountability/effort on the government's part to check claims prior to approval. 
  - e.g. "State hasn't completed a full audit of the program since 2001."
  - Somehow the state reports "more people entering the workforce" than ever, despite recession (Aug 2007 speficially paying out $43.7M in subsidies, $6M more than any other month in the program's documented history)

### What are the limitations of the data?
- Article admits state and county regulators refused to release formal datasets/records so author had to obtain "thousands" of pages from various scattered sources
- Article also states data was collected via spotchecks, which require massive amounts of time and energy (read: they likely only have a small piece of this story - likely many, many more dollars spent incorrectly that are unaccounted for).
